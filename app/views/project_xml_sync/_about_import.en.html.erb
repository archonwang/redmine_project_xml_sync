<p>To import tasks, choose an XML file stored locally on your computer using the button below, then use the "Analyse" button to upload the file. Please be patient - XML project files can be very large and may take a while to upload and analyse. You can GZip the XML file and upload that instead to save on upload time if you are working with low bandwidth.</p>
<p>When analysis is complete, a summary of the tasks that have been found will be presented, allowing you to control exactly which tasks are imported.</p>
